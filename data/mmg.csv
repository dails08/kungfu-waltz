First King of England,871,871 AD,1008,History,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_monarchs,20.8,I know the kings of England,"The first king of England, from a historically defensible persepective.  Alfred the Great founded the House of Wessex and began the first unbroken line of monarchs laying claim to all of England."
Battle of Marathon,-490,490 BC,2369,Military,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Marathon,22.8,"I quote the fights historical, from Marathon to Waterloo in order categorical","The Battle of Marathon was a major turning point in the first Persion Invasion and paved the way for mdoern western civilization.  It makes sense the Major General would study this and in fact the subject, and Herodotus in general, is still studied at military academies to this day."
Battle of Waterloo,1815,1815 AD,64,Military,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo,23.5,"I quote the fights historical, from Marathon to Waterloo in order categorical","The Battle of Waterloo was Napoleans major defeat and the end of his reign.  Another historically important battle, good on the Major General for studying it."
Quadratic Equations,-1990,1990 BC,3879,Math,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation#History,30,"I'm very well acquainted, too, with matter mathematical, I understand equations both the simple and quadratical","Like all math, quadratics started as a purely theoretical concept and was eventually discovered to serve well as a model for ballistics.  Since he later refers to his contemporary awareness of advances in gunnery, studying quadratics would actually be useful to a flag officer like Stanley.  John Dahlgren famously applied creative math and physics to design extremely effective naval guns."
Binomial Theorem,-400,400 BC,2279,Math,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_theorem#History,31.5,About binomial theorem I'm teeming with a lot of news,Here's our first misstep.  Binomials have zero practical application for military leadership and engineering and has only recently acquired any practical application at all.  We begin here to see the folly of the Major General's proud education.
Hypotenuse,-300,300 BC,2179,Math,https://numberwarrior.wordpress.com/2008/11/11/on-the-word-hypotenuse/,38.7,With many cheeful facts about the square of the hypotenuse,"The concept of a hypotenuse is much older, but the use of the word to describe what we use it for now is much younger.  Stanley specifically mentions the square of the hypotenuse, implying the Pythagorean Theorem.  That actually has some use, especially in the calculus of related rates."
Calculus,1687,1687 AD,192,Math,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus#History,50.5,I'm fairly good at integral and differential calculus,"Calculus, the methods of infinity and rates of change, has widespread application in every subject.  I hardly believe he'd use it regularly, but at least it's a definsible subject to learn."
Binomial Nomenclature,1753,1753 AD,126,Science,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature,51.9,I know the scientific names of beings animalculous,Carl Linneus came up with a formal way to classify living things.  By 1753 it was organized enough for academic adoption and is still largely in place today.  Totally useless from a military perspective.
King Arthur,500,500 AD,1379,History,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur#Debated_historicity,65.3,"I know our mythic histories, King Arthuer's and Sir Caradoc's",A good patriot should know his country's origins.  This makes sense.
Sir Caradoc,500,500 AD,1379,Military,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caradoc,66,"I know our mythic histories, King Arthuer's and Sir Caradoc's","Similar to King Arthur, the mythos and involved personalities of a country's heritage are important, if for no other reason than to breed patriotism."
Acrostics,-586,586 BC,2465,Logic,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrostic,67.5,I answer hard acrostics,"This is a bit curious.  Acrostics as a wordplay have existed since antiquity, but they weren't developed as puzzles untul 1935, several decades after Pirates of Penzance was produced.  The Major General says he ""answers hard acrostics,"" implying that he's working on a puzzle of some kind, but he couldn't possible be, nor could Gilbert and Sullivan have known what an acrostic puzzle was.  Odd."
Paradox,-490,490 BC,2369,Logic,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes,68.9,I've a pretty taste for paradox,"Logic as a topic is much older than the concept of a paradox, but the earliest named paradox I could find is the one I expected to: Zeno's.  I considered citing logical axioms like Modus Tollens, but something so ancient is difficult to place in history.  Plus I'm lazy.  In any case, formalized cirtical thinking is important in an officer, or at least that's what they told me at the Academy, so this one's ok."
Elegiacs,-340,340 BC,2219,Literature,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elegiac#Classical_poets,70,I quote in elegiacs all the crimes of Heliogabalus,One of the myriad ways to rhyme stuff in the family of <x>ic <y>meter.  Should an officer be well-read?  My English professors certainly thought so.
Heliogabalus,203,203 AD,1676,History,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elagabalus,71.3,I quote in elegiacs all the crimes of Heliogabalus,"A Roman emperor who had odd sexual practices, even for a Roman.  Much less a ruler than a hedonist, he was assassinated so an actual ruler could take his place.  Happens a lot to emperors, I guess."
Conics,-320,320 BC,2199,Math,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section#History,72,In conics I can floor peculiarities parabolous,"Classical liberal artists, like those produced at St. John's College, will know the odd origin of conics has a multitude of commonplace applications today.  Pretty interesting to visualize how these shapes relate to cones."
Rapheal,1520,1520 AD,359,Art,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael,75.7,I can tell undoubted Raphaels from Gerard Dows and Zoffanies,"I cannot imagine how furious I would be if I produced the kind of cultural influence as Raphael da Urbino did only to have my name stolen by a cartoon turtle.  As for the Major General, his boasts here are rather empty; it is by definition trviial to identify an ""undoubted Raphael,"" so he won't impress many people with this one."
Gerard Dow,1613,1613 AD,266,Art,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Dou,76.4,I can tell undoubted Raphaels from Gerard Dows and Zoffanies,"The Major General apparently considers Dow's work to be less impressive than Raphael's.  Defensible, I suppose, but a bit pompous.  Plus historical art critique has only come up like twice for me in the line of duty."
Zoffany,1733,1733 AD,146,Art,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Zoffany,76.9,I can tell undoubted Raphaels from Gerard Dows and Zoffanies,"Again, poor Zoffany gets to compete with Raphael.  If a war breaks out over which painters are which, Stanley will be the go-to man to lead the charge."
The Frogs,-405,405 BC,2284,Art,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frogs,78,I know the croaked chorus from the Frogs of Aristophanes,"Stanley makes it sound like a cultural reference, but he's literally just saying he can make frog noises.  Good work, boss."
Fugue,1550,1550 AD,329,Art,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue#History,80.1,Then I can hum a fugue of which I've heard the music's din afore,"A fugue, by definition, has multiple parts that oppose each other in a couple of potential ways.  It is impossible for one man to hum a fugue in the same way it's impossible for a man to be his own backup singer.  Having heard the music's din afore has no bearing on this, I'm afraid."
HMS Pinafore,1878,1878 AD,1,Art,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.M.S._Pinafore,88,And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinafore,"A cheeky reference to Gilbert and Sullivan's most popular play, produce the year before Pirates."
Babylonic Cuneiform,-2000,2000 BC,3879,History,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform_script,99,Then I can write a washing bill in Babylonic cuneiform,Writing things in what could be the deadest of all languages is about as useless as skills come.  He could make a decent historian though.
Caractacus (Man),50,50 AD,1829,History,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caratacus,101.2,And tell you every detail of Caractacus's uniform,"The Major General could be referring to the warrior chieftan Sir Caradoc, but based on his specification of his uniform, he's more likely talking about the statue struck in the 1800s."
Caractacus (Statue),1859,1859 AD,20,Art, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major-General%27s_Song#ref_4,101.2,And tell you every detail of Caractacus's uniform,"The statue of Caractacus features him wearing only a loincloth, so it's not much of an accomplishment that the Major General can tell you every detail of his uniform."
Mamelon,1850,1850 AD,29,Military,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamelon_(fort),117.5,In fact when I know what is meant by mamelon and ravelin,"It's been a while since we heard about some actual, concrete military science.  It's about time."
Ravelin,1850,1850 AD,29,Military,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravelin,118.5,In fact when I know what is meant by mamelon and ravelin,Second in a series of contemporarily relevant military knowledge.
Mauser Rifle,1870,1870 AD,9,Military,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauser,121,When I can tell at sight a Mauser rifle from a javelin,"At the time, Mausers were new and quite impressive in terms of reliability and capability.  They were the service weapon of Germany for some time.  While it's nice that this is militarily relevant, I'd certainly hope the Major General can identify one.  Further, it takes precisely zero military training to be able to tell which is the rifle between a mauser and, of all things, a pointed stick."
Commissariat,1869,1869 AD,10,Military,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissariat,128,And when I know precisely what is meant by Commissariat,In context this almost certainly refers to the contemporary program for British civilians to become officers in the army.
Nunnery,1599,1599 AD,280,Art,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet,134.4,When I know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery,"Again, the Major General defeats himself.  He claims to ""know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery.""  Thanks to Bill Shakespeare, ""nunnery"" was slang for a brothel.  A novice in a nunnery implies a virgin in a brothel who would certainly have no knowledge of what to do.  The fact that a Major General is more comfortable with tactics than a virgin is with prostitues is hardly comendable."
Gee,1600,1600 AD,279,Military,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gee_and_haw,146,You'll say a better Major General has never sat a gee,"Calling a horse a gee was already antiquated by the time Stanley earned his commission.  In this sense, it would be true, no matter his quality as an officer, that a better Major General has never sat a gee.  Sigh.  He's the worst."
Beginning of the Century,1800,1800 AD,79,Military,,158,"For my military knowledge, though I'm plucky and adventurey, has only been brought down to the beginning of the century","For all his boasting, he seems to recognize that he lacks military training as would be expected.  At least we got a good song out of it."
