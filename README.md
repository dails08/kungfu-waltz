A playful attempt to apply d3 to Pirates of Penzance.

d3 is one of my three priorities for immediate continued study post master's and this project is an attempt to grow more familiar with the principles of d3.  I intend to learn and practice from first principles in the academic style before adopting and modifying existing code; theory is the basis for practice, after all, and a strong foundation will provide a strong structure.  I expect initial endeavors will be sloppy and crude but they'll certainly improve.

Since learning and projects in general are more enjoyable when applied to familiar and interesting subjects, I've chosen to visualize just how modern Major General Stanley is as professed in The Major General's Song, one of my broadways favorites.  I'd like to plot on a linear scale how recent (to Stanley) his referred examples of expertise are and present some commentary on each topic as well as a breakdown of his areas of expertise.  Eventually I'd like to enrich the experience by playing the song and having the visualization match the music, but all in good time.
